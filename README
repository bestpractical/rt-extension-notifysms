        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

DESCRIPTION
    Provide additional actions for Scrips, that allow for the sending of SMS
    messages based on actions in RT.

    Notify SMS actions use the Mobile Phone value from each user record. If
    the user has no Mobile Phone set, no message is sent.

    After installation you will see new notification actions are available
    for your RT scrips.

    If notifying a more specific role on a ticket is desired, create a new
    action in the RT web UI:

        Admin->Global->Actions

    The "Action Module" is "NotifyTwilio". In the "Parameters to Pass"
    section provide one or more of the following:

        All, Owner, Requestor, AdminCc, Cc

    The content of your outgoing SMS alerts is set using RT templates the
    same way email notification content is set. One caveat is that SMS
    notification templates should not have any header values, meaning that
    they will have a blank line as the first line in the template ( Only
    applicable for Perl templates ).

    To send "on reply" content via SMS use the following template:

    {$Transaction->Content()}

    With an empty line before the above code.

CONFIGURATION
    Currently this extension supports the Twilio SMS service.

  Twilio
    To send a message using the Twilio web API, set the following values in
    RT_SiteConfig.pm:

            Set( $TwilioAccounId, 'Secret' );
            Set( $TwilioAuthToken, 'Secret' );
            Set( $APIURL, 'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/' );
            Set( $APIDomain, 'api.twilio.com:443' );
            Set( $APIRealm, 'Twilio API' );
            Set( $MessageSender, '0123456789' );

    To obtain a Twilio AuthToken and AccountId, create a new project of type
    programmable SMS in the Twilio console. These values can be found in
    your Twilio account <https://www.twilio.com/console>.
